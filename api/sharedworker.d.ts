/**
 * ### Shared worker
 * 
 * A shared worker is composed of 2 elements:
 * - A thread running the shared worker
 * - One or more proxies communicating with the worker thread
 * 
 * ### Step 1: Define the shared worker
 * 
 * ```javascript
 * // PROJECT/backend/worker.js
 * // onconnect is called everytime a new worker proxy is created
 * onconnect = function( msg )
 * {
 *     // Get the worker port for communication with the worker proxy
 *     // Always use `ports[0]`
 *     var workerPort = msg.ports[0];
 * 
 *     // Send a message to the worker proxy. The worker is up and running.
 *     workerPort.postMessage({type: 'connected', says: "I'm alive!"});
 * 
 *     // Listen for worker proxy messages
 *     workerPort.onmessage = function( event )
 *     {
 *         // Worker receives a message !
 *         // The `event.data` is what the worker proxy sends using `postMessage()`. Could be a String, Number or an Object type.
 *         // Here, `event.data` contains an object: `{type: String, says: String}`
 *         var message = event.data;
 *         switch( message.type )
 *         {
 *             // It's a hello world message
 *             case 'hello':
 *                 console.log( '[RECEIVED BY WORKER] '+ event.says );
 *                 // Reply to the worker proxy
 *                 workerPort.postMessage( {type: 'hello', says: 'Hello proxy!'} );
 *                 break;
 * 
 *             // It's a terminate message
 *             case 'close':
 *                 console.log( '[RECEIVED BY WORKER] '+ event.says );
 *                 // Reply to the worker proxy
 *                 workerPort.postMessage( {type: 'close', says: 'I will be back!'} );
 *                 // Close the worker
 *                 console.log( '[WORKER] Worker stops' );
 *                 close();
 *                 break;
 * 
 *             // It's something else. Skip it.
 *             default:
 *                 break;
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * #### How to require a wakanda module ?
 * The module should be defined in `PROJECT/backend/modules`
 * 
 * ```javascript
 * var myModule = require( 'myModule' );
 * ```
 * 
 * ### Step 2: Create the shared worker thread and get the worker proxy
 * 
 * ```javascript
 * // PROJECT/backend/proxy.js
 * // Create a new SharedWorker and get the proxy worker
 * var myWorkerProxy = new SharedWorker( 'backend/worker.js', 'my-worker-name' );
 * // Get the proxy worker port for communication
 * var workerProxyPort = myWorkerProxy.port;
 * // Send a "hello" message to the worker
 * workerProxyPort.postMessage( {type: 'hello', says: 'Hello worker !'} );
 * ```
 * 
 * ### Step 3: Listen for shared worker messages
 * 
 * ```javascript
 * // PROJECT/backend/proxy.js
 * // Listen for worker thread messages
 * workerProxyPort.onmessage = function( event )
 * {
 *     // Proxy receives a message !
 *     // Same as before, the `event.data` is what the worker proxy sends using `postMessage()`. Could be a String, Number or an Object type.
 *     // Here, `event.data` contains an object: `{type: String, says: String}`
 *     var message = event.data;
 *     switch( message.type )
 *     {
 *         // It's a hello world message
 *         case 'hello':
 *             console.log( '[RECEIVED BY PROXY] '+ event.says );
 *             // Say by to the worker
 *             workerProxyPort.postMessage( {type: 'close', says: 'Bye bye worker!'} );
 *             break;
 * 
 *         // It's a terminate message
 *         case 'close':
 *             console.log( '[RECEIVED BY PROXY] '+ event.says );
 * 
 *         // It's something else. Skip it.
 *         default:
 *             break;
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
